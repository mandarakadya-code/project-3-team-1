# project-3-team-1
Overview of project
---------------------
This project analyses which countries are responsible for the carbon emissions. It takes into consideration the current carbon emissions trend by countries and compares that with the historic data (1960-1980) and also takes into account the carbon footprint per person by country. With these analyses, we could find that the countries currently producing the maximum emission currently was not in the top 40 years ago. Also, the carbon footprint per person gives insight into countries that have lesser population that produce more emissions than countries with more population.
